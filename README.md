# Vortex-privacy-policy
Vortex is a secure and customizable Discord bot with moderation, automod, anti-nuke, welcome messages, reaction roles, and giveaways. It only stores minimal non-personal data needed to function, never permanently logs messages, and allows full data removal on request. Privacy first.

Thank you for choosing Vortex! This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use the Vortex Discord bot. By using Vortex, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

📊 Data Collection

Vortex is a free-to-use Discord bot that offers powerful features like automod, antispam, anti-nuke, welcome messages, role assignment, and giveaways. To function properly, Vortex collects and stores limited non-personal data:

Server IDs – to manage configurations on a per-server basis.

User IDs – used for automoderation logs, punishments, blacklist tracking, and custom role systems.

Channel & Role IDs – for handling welcome channels, log channels, reaction roles, and automod targets.

Message Content – temporarily analyzed to detect spam, invites, banned words, etc. We do not store message content permanently.

Server Settings – like thresholds, punishments, and toggleable features per module.


All collected data is securely stored and encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256).

🛠 Use of Data

We use collected data solely for the following:

Enabling and configuring Vortex’s core features.

Executing moderation actions (mute, ban, warn, etc.).

Improving stability, performance, and user experience.

Providing debugging support and bug resolution.


We never sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

🧠 Message Monitoring

Vortex monitors messages in real time to detect and respond to:

Spam, flooding, or repeated content.

Blacklisted keywords or banned links.

Unwanted invites or scam messages.


This processing happens in memory only and is not stored or logged unless moderation action is taken (e.g., a warning or mute), in which case only the metadata is retained (not full message content).

🔐 Access to Data

Only server owners and administrators can view or manage their server’s data.

Bot developers may access server data strictly for bug fixing, support, or improving features.


Access to sensitive information is controlled and monitored internally.

📦 Data Storage & Retention

Server data is retained as long as Vortex is present in the server.

If Vortex is removed, data is retained for 7 days to support easy re-setup.

Data may be permanently deleted upon request by a verified server owner.


🧹 Data Deletion

To request data deletion, please contact us with your Server ID and proof of server ownership. We'll delete your data from our systems within a reasonable timeframe.
